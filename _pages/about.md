I am a researcher in computational materials science interested in the intersection of machine learning with traditional simulation techniques.
My recent work has spanned computational materials discovery, machine learning applied to first principles simulation, and battery informatics.

I currently work as a senior research scientist at Toyota Research Institute. You can view the papers that I've written on my [Google Scholar.](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=a8UA3n8AAAAJ)

I am passionate about serving the scientific and academic communities in my spare time. I currently serve on the [external advisory board of the UC Merced Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://me.ucmerced.edu/advisory-board).


Prior to that, I was a DOE Computational Science Graduate Fellow, and a Barry Goldwater scholar. I obtained my Ph.D. in Physics with a secondary in computational science & engineering from Harvard University, where I worked under Prof. Boris Kozinsky, and a B.S. in Physics and a B.A. in Mathematics from the University of Rochester.

## ðŸ§ª Research Directions {#research}

My work sits at the intersection of machine learning, computational materials science, and data-driven discovery. I focus on building interpretable and scalable models that interface with first-principles simulations, spectroscopic experiments, and electrochemical devices.

### 1. Machine Learning from First-Principles Simulations

I am interested in ML models â€” including surrogate models, interatomic potentials, and property predictors â€” that accelerate traditional quantum simulations and uncover patterns in atomistic simulation.

- ðŸ“„ [Benchmarking FLARE and NequIP with the TM23 Dataset](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-024-01264-z)  
  *Owen & Torrisi, npj Computational Materials (Co-first author)*
- ðŸ“„ [On-the-Fly Active Learning of Bayesian Force Fields](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-020-0283-z)  
  *Vandermause, Torrisi, et al., npj Computational Materials*

### 2. Interpretable Spectroscopy

I am interested ins ML frameworks to interpret spectroscopic data â€” particularly X-ray absorption and PDF â€” in a way that allows practitioners to build chemical intuition and understand physical structure. I am particularly interested in interpretable methods that link spectral variation to local atomic environments.

**Selected Works:**
- ðŸ“„ [Multimodal Analysis of PDF and X-ray Absorption Spectra](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01589-3)  
  *Na Narong, Zachko, Torrisi & Billinge, npj Computational Materials (Corresponding Author with Simon Billinge)*
- ðŸ“„ [Random Forest Models for Interpretable XANES Spectra](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-020-00376-6)  
  *Torrisi et al., npj Computational Materials*

### 3. Electrochemical Materials and Device Informatics

I work on data-centric models for battery science â€” combining simulation, experiment, and statistical modeling to study device-level behavior and materials discovery for next-generation energy storage.

**Selected Works:**
- ðŸ“„ [Interpretable Analysis of Battery Formation](https://www.cell.com/joule/abstract/S2542-4351(24)00353-2?__cf_chl_tk=3ipJBoh4IH4KGjMpuaKZ4qfBStVw6d36Kg52N6mmZGI-1748287168-1.0.1.1-kovUBpZ2r_gvoiRUcJJtKcz31DXp14ItE3qcihE7MUg)

  *Ansari, Torrisi, Trewartha, Sun, Journal of Energy Storage*



My interests

I am passionate about science communication, funk music, and mentorship. While I was a Ph.D. student at Harvard, I was a resident tutor at Cabot House for four very happy years.
